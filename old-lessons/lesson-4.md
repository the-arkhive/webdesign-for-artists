## Adding Some Complexity and Early HTML
In this lesson we will start to learn what is going on behind the scenes with our Markdown based site, and bridge the gap between that and a static HTML website. This will prep us for learning full blown HTML and beyond that CSS. Not all those acronyms will make sense yet, but that's alright, as we progress it will begin to make sense.

### Some Terminology
Okay, this section will be a little dry, but it provides some helpful background information that gives some context to what we will be learning next. I am going to run through some terminology that we have already used, and start to connect it to some terms that you have probably heard, but might not know exactly.

- [Markup Language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language) - This refers broadly to programming languages used to style text. From websites to recipes there are many of these, but they all provide a way of formatting content to display the way you want.
- [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) - HTML stands for `Hypertext Markup Language` which is what internet browsers are designed to display.
- [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) - Markdown is a wonderful language that provides a dead simple set of commands that make it easy to go from text to HTML. It was made by John Gruber and if you'd like some info right from the source you can check out his page for it [HERE](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)

We will get into some more terminology later, but for now this will do. The big take away here is to understand the connection between markup languages as a whole and then how Markdown is made to simplify the production of HTML. This can begin to shed some light on what is happening with our GitHub pages site. In essence Any page you visit on a web browser is converted to HTML as the final step. Some websites are not made directly in HTML and instead use another language entirely that then specifies what HTML to generate for the browser to display, but in the end, everything is HTML. Our GitHub based page is doing exactly the same thing. For now we are writing Markdown, which is then getting converted to HTML to be displayed in a browser. So let's begin to explore the HTML that our Markdown generates.



### Browser Developer Tools - Page Source
I am going to assume that the majority of people use Google Chrome, though I would personally recommend Mozilla Firefox for reasons I will not get into here, so this section will be geared mostly towards that, though is very transferable to other browsers. The basic goal here is to be able to look at the underlying HTML of the web page we just created using Markdown. This part is pretty simple honestly, especially for how useful it will be. For Chrome you should be able to simply right click and select `View Page Source`, which is pretty much the same in all browsers, you just might need to enable developer tools for your specific browser. You can do this on any page, but it will probably be a bit overwhelming, so let's start with the page we made using GitHub Pages. If for some reason you have not completed that part of this project yet I made a dummy site you can fiddle with [HERE](https://thomas-williams.github.io/training-repo/).

So, on your own page or on the one I provided, right click, and select `View Page Source`. A new tab will open with an imposing page of code. Don't worry we are going to break this down into much more digestible pieces and for now a lot of what you see you don't need to worry yourself with. Our main goal here is to find how to Markdown we wrote is being turned into the HTML required for it to display as a webpage in a browser.
