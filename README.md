# Basic Web Design for Artists
My goal here is to provide a dead simple tutorial to get started in personal website hosting. When I left undergrad and started looking for jobs to apply to with my art degree every one I was interested in required an online portfolio. I wasn't happy with any of the template based website services, and the ones I was were expensive. So I started to learn how to host my own, for as cheap as possible, and with as much customization I could want. This meant starting with what I knew and could learn quickly, then scaling up to a website that is not only functional as a portfolio, but one that I am proud to show off as well. Though that new site is not live yet, I have gotten into a rhythm of learning new things to improve it, so everyday I get closer to my vision of the site and what I want it to be.
