# Basic Web Design for Artists
My goal here is to provide a dead simple tutorial to get started in personal website design and hosting. When I left undergrad and started looking for jobs to apply to with my art degree, every one I was interested in required an online portfolio. I wasn't happy with any of the template based website services, and the ones I was were expensive. So I started to learn how to host my own, for as cheap as possible, and with as much customization I could want. This meant starting with what I knew and could learn quickly, then scaling up to a website that is not only functional as a portfolio, but one that I am proud to show off as well. Though that new site is not live yet, I have gotten into a rhythm of learning new things to improve it, so everyday I get closer to my vision of the site and what I want it to be.

The documents in the repositry are essentially an amalgamation of may tutorials I followed and posts I read while troubleshooting my own projects that I would now like to provide to others in a single unified tutorial. This is not meant to be the end all be all tutorial on every tools or service I use, but instead a tutorial for a specific thing - cheap as possible, custom websites - and how I have developed a process I think is both simple to maintain and change, as well as scalable.
